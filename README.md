# GoogleHotkeys

This is a simple program I created for my father 2 years ago. It is probably one of the few things I made that are actually useful.  
When pressing down the hotkey, any marked text (not limited to the browser) will be opened in google translate or as a search query in google search.

__Obviously not all hotkey combinations will work, since some are reserved by windows or for other reasons.__
